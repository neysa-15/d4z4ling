1. Bugs with particular read:
   JOUB61166
   - "ca43959f-8cdd-466b-97e8-c76aede61765": Duplex read to check with odd positioning of D4Z4 repeats
   AS2603
   - "c95c3baa-460b-4c09-a80c-4e2a229603d0": has a very short D4z4_chr4_proximal that is the opposite strand of everything else
   - "37b3da42-79a6-4022-9139-ce8e5efa28ca": another duplex with weird position  
   - "a8a394f9-d6d1-4ed4-bd57-4dba11a67592": another duplex with weird position of repeats
   - "2bcd44d2-ba99-45f5-81f6-72bd25bd1035": "-" has SSLP but "+" doesn't? And duplex optimal should take in "-" instead
   - 14/3/2025 (same before after flipping - to + :
     87fb01b1-7ffa-4d27-85bc-a18928227712: Duplex, the 4qB is in the middle of the repeats for negative strand
     2bcd44d2-ba99-45f5-81f6-72bd25bd1035, 15ced10e-caf4-4d99-b0e7-80e62790651f: Duplex, and 2 strands each

2. Current duplex check are only for the reads that have features, not if there's only repeats

3. 4A161L detection script are sometimes mapping better to repeats that's not the distal copy

4. Current distal methylation method are only checking for d4z4 that overlap with pLAM, not any known distal copies
